Re-Design of Turners Cars website. This was a project during my time with Mission Ready and was completed in collaboration with a UX designer, I only did the programming portion of the project.

This web application uses React and is deployed using GitHub Actions and Firebase Hosting. The actions can be viewed in .github/workflows/main.yml
