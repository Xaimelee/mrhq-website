## Mission Ready, Turners.co.nz Project

Redesign of [Turners.co.nz](https://www.turners.co.nz/?activetab=carsearch) website. This was a week long project during my time with Mission Ready and was completed in collaboration with a UX designer, I only did the programming portion of the project. The entire MVP was not implemented, this is only the frontpage of the redesign.

This web application uses React and is deployed using GitHub Actions and Firebase Hosting which creates a CI/CD pipeline. The actions can be viewed in '.github/workflows/main.yml'. You can view the web application currently live on Firebase Hosting [here](https://mrhq-website.firebaseapp.com).
